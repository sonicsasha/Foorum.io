# Foorumi
A project for the course "Application for Databases" at University of Helsinki. This is a simple forum where users can create an account, select a specific topic, create a new thread for that topic and respond to threads created by other users.

# Users
Anyone can create a user account and log in to their account. There are three levels of account power: User, Moderator and Admin.

A user can create threads, respond to other threads, edit their own messages as well as delete them.

A moderator can do anything a user can do, but also create new topics including hidden ones where only specific users are allowed to access them and delete any message on any thread.

An admin can do everything a moderator can do, but also nominate other users to a moderator or an admin status, as well as edit any messages on the forum.
